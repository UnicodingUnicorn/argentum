#Intro
A nodejs/MEVN stack rebuild-ish of the excellent (albeit commentless) [Ponyville Live](https://github.com/Poniverse/Ponyville-Live) webapp by SilverEagle. Please don't ask about the name. It's also pretty much still in development and probably cannot even hope to live up to even a shadow of the glory of its forebear. Sorry.

The backend is intended to be completely standalone and interacts with the frontend through a series of API calls.
